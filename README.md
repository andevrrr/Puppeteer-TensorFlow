# Puppeteer-TensorFlow

The project aims to develop a system that automates the evaluation of web designs by using Puppeteer to extract detailed data from websites, including visual elements and user interactions, and then applying TensorFlow to analyze this data and determine the quality of the design based on aesthetics, usability, responsiveness, and performance metrics. This system will provide objective feedback on web designs, helping designers and developers improve their work and align with best practices and current trends in web design.
